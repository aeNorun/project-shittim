# project-shittim
This is just my documentation of my homelab "Shittim" where I make an Arona-voiced home assistant and NAS.
Sometime in the future I also want to make an Arona-voiced local AI (not really cause i have no money) kek. 

## Softwares
### 1. Home Assistant
This is kinda the main reason I want to make this. I use Home Assistant OS that i run on my [HP 800 G3 Mini PC](https://github.com/aeNorun/project-shittim?tab=readme-ov-file#1-hp-elitedesk-800-g3-tiny).

I use [whisper](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/whisper/) and [openwakeword](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/create_wake_word/) for the voice assistant.
I install [samba](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os/#installing-and-using-the-samba-add-on) for transfering voice lines audio from my personal desktop to the machine that runs the home assistant os.


## Hardwares
### 1. HP Elitedesk 800 G3 Tiny

Specification: 
```
CPU Intel Core i3 6100
GPU Intel® HD Graphics 530 (integrated)
RAM 4gb DDR4 2133MHz
Storage SSD 150gb
```
#### Notes:
There is 2 types of this mini pc, there is a 65W one and 35W one (What I have is the 35W version)

The issue with the 35W one is it doesn't come with a hhdfan


### 2. Networking
For the cabling and networking I use **cat5e cable** and **Tapo TP-Link LS1008** for the switch.
