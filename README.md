This is just my documentation of my homelab "Shittim" where I make an Arona-voiced home assistant and NAS.
Sometime in the future I also want to make an Arona-voiced local AI.

## Softwares
### 1. Home Assistant
This is kinda the main reason I want to make this. I use Home Assistant OS that i run on my [HP mini PC](https://github.com/aeNorun/project-shittim/edit/main/README.md#1-hp-elitedesk-800-g3-tiny).

## Hardwares
### 1. HP Elitedesk 800 G3 Tiny


### 2. Lenovo Thinkcentre m700 Tower 
I bought this from Facebook Marketplace for Rp. 650.000 or about 40 USD. I also upgrade the RAM to 8gb for Rp. 193.000 or about 12 USD

Specification:
```
CPU Intel Core i3 6100
    2 Cores, 4 Threads
GPU Intel® HD Graphics 530 (integrated with cpu)
RAM 8gb DDR4 2666MHz (bottlenecked by cpu becomes 2133MHz)
Storage HDD 500gb 
```
Notes: 
```

```
### 3. Networking
