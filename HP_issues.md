# HP Mini PC issues
For me, the HP 800 G3 Mini has a major issue that is very weird. In the 35w variant of the HP 800 G3 Mini there is no fan under the sata ssd/hdd housing.

In spite of not having a hdd fan from the factory, weirdly everytime I boot this mini PC this message shows up at every boot.




### Solution
THe solution is simply short the 2 pins to trick the bios firmware into thinking that theres a fan connected in the hddfan slot.
